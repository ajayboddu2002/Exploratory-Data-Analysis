Project List
Project 1: IPL Auction 2023 Analysis

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL Auction 2023 dataset. The dataset contains 309 records with player details such as their nationality, player style, base price, final price, and their franchise if they were sold. The dataset provides insights into player retention, unsold players, and the financial aspect of the auction.

Columns in the dataset:
name: Player's name.
player style: The role of the player (e.g., Bowler, Batter, Allrounder).
nationality: The player's nationality.
base price (in lacs): The base price of the player in the auction (in lakhs of INR).
final price (in lacs): The final price the player was sold for in the auction (in lakhs of INR).
franchise: The team that bought the player.
status: The player's auction status (e.g., SOLD, UNSOLD, RETAINED).
Key Insights:
Sold vs Unsold Players: The dataset shows the number of players who were sold, unsold, and retained during the auction.
Price Comparisons: A comparison between the base price and the final price helps in identifying undervalued and overvalued players.
Nationality Representation: Breakdown of the players by nationality to see which countries had the most representation.
Player Style Distribution: Understanding the distribution of different player types (batter, bowler, allrounder) across the auction.
Franchise Purchases: Analysis of which franchises spent the most and which secured the most players.
